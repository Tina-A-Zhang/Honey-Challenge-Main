### Description
This PR includes my solution for the three-part coding exercise. The primary focus areas were:

- **Part 1**: Calculated the total energy usage of an appliance based on its on/off events across a day.
- **Part 2**: Extended the calculation to account for energy savings using an energy-saving device that automatically powers off the appliance after inactivity.
- **Part 3**: Calculated energy usage for specific days in a multi-day profile, accommodating arbitrary start and end times for each day.

### Key Highlights
- **Code Structure**: Focused on readability, modularity, and maintainability for easy future updates and testing.
- **Validation and Edge Cases**: Included comprehensive input validation and handled edge cases as described in the prompt.
- **Testing**: Implemented extensive tests to ensure each function's reliability, covering standard and edge cases.
- **Documentation**: Each function includes inline comments and JSDoc annotations for clarity and context.

### How to test
- **To Run**: Use `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm test` to run the test suite.
- **Format**: Code is formatted according with `npm run format`.

Please let me know if there are any questions or additional adjustments required. Looking forward to your feedback!
